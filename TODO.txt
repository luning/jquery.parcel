TODO

[ ] update documentation according to recent changes
[ ] build parcel with multiple behaviours
[ ]?? set state will remove item from array parcel if needed
[ ] support non-input as a field(readonly)
[ ] optimize implementation of removeMe()
[ ] rename _clean to _clear
[ ] consider making option.check default to be true while setting state
[ ] use smoke mocks rather than roll our own
[ ] consider renaming initialState() => initial or pristine?, resetState() => reset or revert, captureState() => save. 4 actions: get the last saved state, reset to blank, revert to the last saved state, save state.
[ ] support textarea, multi-select and select-one
[ ] make show/hide speed and effect configurable
[ ] support rails style forms and hierarchies (ie name="person[address][street]")

potential problems:
[ ] remove a DOM with many fields will fire change event multiple times unexpectedly, once on each field's closest alive original parent.


[ ] custom DOM attributes are potentially undesirable
  - need to consider which path to take
  - see http://www.danwebb.net/2007/10/7/custom-attributes-and-class-names
  - also http://unspace.ca/discover/attributes/
  - could replace with something more 'semantic' like:

$('#parcel').parce({
  field1: ignore,
  field2: rename('f2'),
  field3: virtual
});
