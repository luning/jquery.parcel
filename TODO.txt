TODO

[ ] update documentation according to recent changes
[ ] performance improvement(replace heavy selector, avoid redefine method with fix body, replace frequently called simple selector)
[ ] accept object as behaviour
[ ] consider switching the terms reset and revert, since HTTP FORM reset is similar as the current parcel revert. that means reset to initial/default, revert/?? to blank.
[ ]?? suppress exception on calls against empty jQuery object. $("XXXX").state() will throw by now.
[ ] optimize implementation of removeMe()
[ ] consider making option.check default to be true while setting state
[ ] support textarea, multi-select and select-one
[ ] make show/hide speed and effect configurable
[ ] support rails style forms and hierarchies (ie name="person[address][street]")
[ ] convert to primative value through valueOf() before type checking and equality checking of Number, Boolean and String
[ ] set state with no effect should not fire event

potential problems:
[ ] setting initial state is different with normal setting state, like spinner popups and some other logics are not expected while setting initial state.
[ ] accepting null as a state value representing empty textbox and top option in select may cause inconsistency, state to set(null) is different with the actual state being setted(""). This will break setting state if option.verify = true.
[ ] custom DOM attributes are potentially undesirable
  - need to consider which path to take
  - see http://www.danwebb.net/2007/10/7/custom-attributes-and-class-names
  - also http://unspace.ca/discover/attributes/
  - could replace with something more 'semantic' like:

$('#parcel').parcel({
  field1: ignore,
  field2: rename('f2'),
  field3: virtual
});
